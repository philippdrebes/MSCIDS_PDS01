# Slots-Task 01:
# Answer the questions below.

class A:
    pass

a = A()
a.x = 66
a.y = "dynamically created attribute"

print("a.x: ", a.x)
print("a.y: ", a.y)

# Question 0: How can one show the dict of A and a?

print("---------------")

# example 1:
b = 42       		             # create an integer object named b
# b.x = "not possible to do it"  # Question 1: WHY is it not possible now?
                                 # Question 2: In which dict is 'b' stored?


# example 2:
lst = [34, 999, 1001]	         # create in list object
#lst. x = "forget it!"           # Question 3: WHY is that also not possible?
                                 # Question 4: In which dict is lst saved?
