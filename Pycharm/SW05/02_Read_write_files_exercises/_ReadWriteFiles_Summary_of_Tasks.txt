Read and write files

Exercise 01
***********

Create a file with the name 'names.txt' in which a first name and a surname 
alternate for example like this:

Fred
Miller
Eve
Turner
Steve
Baker
Elsa
Brunner
Hans
Ruckli
Silvia
Muster

The content of this 'names.txt'-file is to be transferred to another file 'names2.txt'.
In the second file 'names2.txt' on every line there should be a first name and a surname
like this output:

Fred Miller
Eve Turner
Steve Baker
Elsa Brunner
Hans Ruckli
Silvia Muster


***********
Exercise 02
***********

Write a program that combines three lines from the file 'musicians.txt' into one each 
and outputs them as standard output using print ().

That means:  An output line should contain the first name, the last name and the artist name ("Künstername") or band of the artist. 
The band or artist name should be outputed in brackets and in captial letters. 
Example "Marshall Bruce Mathers III (EMINEM)"

Brian
Molko
placebo
Jim
Morrison
The Doors
Ray
Davies
The Kinks
Marshall Bruce
Mathers III
Eminem
Andre Romelle
Young
Dr. Dre
Beth
Gibbons
Portishead

Exercise 03
***********

Change the solution of Exercise 02 so that the program writes the output to the file 'musicians2.txt'.
