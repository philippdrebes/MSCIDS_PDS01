# Write a program that combines three lines from the file 'musicians.txt' into one each
# and outputs them as standard output using print ().

# That means:  An output line should contain the first name, the last name and the artist name ("Künstername") or band of the artist.
# The band or artist name should be outputed in brackets and in captial letters.
# Example "Marshall Bruce Mathers III (EMINEM)"

# Brian
# Molko
# placebo
# Jim
# Morrison
# The Doors
# Ray
# Davies
# The Kinks
# Marshall Bruce
# Mathers III
# Eminem
# Andre Romelle
# Young
# Dr. Dre
# Beth
# Gibbons
# Portishead
